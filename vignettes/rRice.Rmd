## Informations about the vignette

In this vignette, you will find how to use the **rRice** package and it will be illustrated by examples. 
To use this package, you will have to create an experiment and then you will be able to work with it :
* Interrogate the databases
* Add manually databases
* Create an array with specific genes and properties

## Examples

### 1.) Create an experiment and add databases

The first thing you will have to do to use the package is to create a new experiment with the `createExperiment(name, locus)` function :
```
locus <- data.frame(ch = c("1"), st = c("148907"), end = c("248907"))
experiment <- createExperiment("newExperiment", locus)
```

Then you will have to follow instructions :
* First you will have to tell how many databases you want to experiment
* Then you will have to give the date of your experiment
* Finally, you will have to choose which databases to choose
    
After succeeding these steps, you will have an operational `experiment` you will be able to use. 

Example :
```
> locus <- data.frame(ch = c("1"), st = c("148907"), end = c("248907"))
> experiment <- createExperiment("newExperiment", locus)
How many databases do you want to experiment ? :1
Enter the date of the experiment (mm/dd/yyyy) : 09/17/2016
loading informations...
The list of the databases : 
1 for RAPDB 
2 for Gramene 
3 for Oryzabase 
4 for IC4R 
5 for Planttfdb 
6 for PLNTFDB 
7 for Funricigenes 
8 for Funricigenes2 
9 for Funricigenes3 
10 for MSU7 
1
```
Then wait for few seconds that your RAPDB database has been well-added to your experiment

### 2.) Consult your experiment

If you want to collect the informations about your `experiment` :
* name : `experiment@name`
* date : `experiment@date`
* databases : `experiment@databases` will return all the databases you have add to your experiment
* genes : `experiment@genes` will return the list of the genes of all the databases you interrogated
* properties : `experiment@properties` will return the list of the properties you selected with `selectProperties(...)`
* others : `experiment@others` will contain a list with your personal informations you added with the function `addAttribute(...)`

Example :
```
> experiment@name
[1] "newExperiment"
> experiment@databases
[[1]]
[1] "RAPDB"
```

### 3.) Add new databases to the experiment

If you wish to add new databases in your variable `experiment` :
```
experiment <- addDBs(experiment)
```

Then you will have to select the number of databases you want to add to your experiment and to choose which database to interrogate. 

Example :
```
> experiment <- addDBs(experiment)
How many databases do you want to experiment ? :1
The list of the databases : 
1 for RAPDB 
2 for Gramene 
3 for Oryzabase 
4 for IC4R 
5 for Planttfdb 
6 for PLNTFDB 
7 for Funricigenes 
8 for Funricigenes2 
9 for Funricigenes3 
10 for MSU7 
2
loading informations of the database...
```
Then wait for few seconds that your RAPDB database has been well-added behind your preexisting databases
Notice that the number of databases of your experiment has been modified :
```
> experiment@databases
[[1]]
[1] "RAPDB"

[[2]]
[1] "Gramene"
```

### 4.) Add manually a new database to the experiment

If you have a personal database you would like to integrate to your variable `experiment` :
```
experiment <- createNewDB(experiment)
```

Then you will have to give few informations about your new database you want to integrate in your experiment : 
* Name of the new database
* The type of id of the first column of the file you want to import (rapdb or msu)
* The separator which is used in the file to separate every datas 
* The path toward the file you want to import

Example : 
```
> experiment <- createNewDB(experiment)
Your file has to be built as follow : 
First line is composed with all the names of the attributes
Others lines composed with all the values of the genes
Write the name of your new db :newDB
What kind of typeID is on the first row of your file (1 : msu; 2 : rapdb) : 2
Which separator is used in your file ? :,
Write the absolute path until your file :/path/towards/my/file.txt
```
Then the new database `newDB` has been well-added to your `experiment` variable and you will find all the genes you added in `experiment@genes`

### 5.) Others useful functions

#### a.) addAttribute function
If you want to add personal informations for your experiment then use this functions as follows :
```
> experiment <- addAttribute(experiment, "newAttribut", "1")
> experiment@others
[[1]]
newAttribut 
        "1" 
```

#### b.) Create an array with specific genes and properties selected by the user

After you added a lot of databases in your variable `experiment`, you may want to create an array with only few genes and few properties. 
To do so, you will have to :
#### 1.) selectProperties function

The goal of this function is to select only the properties of your differents databases of your experiment you want to study :
```
> experiment <- selectProperties(experiment, list("RAPDB.id", "Gramene.geneIdx", "Gene.attribut1"))
> experiment@properties
[[1]]
[1] "RAPDB.id"

[[2]]
[1] "Gramene.geneIdx"

[[3]]
[1] "Gene.attribut1"

```

#### 2.) selectGenes function

The goal of this function is to select only the genes of your databases of your experiment you want to study.
The first argument of your function `selectGenes` is the `experiment`, the second is the list of genes you want to study `listeGenes` (rapdb or msu) and the last refer the type of id genes there are in `listeGenes`.

Example :
```
> listeGenes <- list("Os01g0104600","Os01g0104400")
> experiment <- selectGenes(experiment, listeGenes, "RAPDB")
```

#### 3.) getProperties function

Thanks to 1.) and 2.) we will be able to create an array only with the genes and properties selected above.
The first argument of the `getProperties` function is your variable `experiment` and the second represents which id of the gene will be present in the array (rapdb or msu).

Example :
```
> getProperties(experiment, "RAPDB")
                     rapdb.id gramene.geneidx gene.attribut1
Os01g0104400 OsNippo01g013050              72             12
Os01g0104600 OsNippo01g013200              75             14
```
